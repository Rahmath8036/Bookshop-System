Welcome to the Bookshop System! This project is a comprehensive bookshop management system implemented using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It features a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for an interactive experience.

Features

1. Search and Filter: Find books easily by searching and filtering through various categories.
2. Sort Books: Sort books by different criteria such as paperbacks, audio books, and ebooks.
3. Checkout: Manage the checkout process, including reducing credit in the basket.
4. Basket Management: Options to clear the basket, view items in the basket and manage items efficiently.
5. Interactive GUI: A user-friendly interface for easy navigation and operation.

OOP Principles Utilized

1. Encapsulation: Data hiding is implemented to protect book details and user information.
2. Inheritance: Common functionality is shared among classes to promote code reuse.
3. Polymorphism: Different behaviors are implemented through method overriding and interfaces.
4. Abstraction: Simplified interfaces are provided for complex operations, enhancing usability.
